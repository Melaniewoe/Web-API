Assignment 1

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={{book_title}} 
This will get a JSON response of books where the environment variable "book_title" is set to Turing. The result than can be 
parsed and the variable can stored in a postman variable. With this environment variable, we can get the response depending
on what the key value is declared.

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/{{id}} 
this http header takes the variable from the first http header, id, and shows the response with that id number. 

Headers

Alt-Svc →quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="35,34"
tells about an alternative “route’ to the same content for the same origin server that where the response is from.

Cache-Control →private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
Cache-control specify directives for caching mechanisms in both, requests and responses. 
Private -> is for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache
Max-age -> the maximum time in seconds that the fetched response is allowed to be reused from the time of the request
Must-revalidate -> if the response is stale, caches must first revalidate it with the origin server
No-transform -> cache must not changed

Content-Length →34103
It indicates the size of the entity-body

Content-Type →application/json; charset=UTF-8
designates the content to be in JSON format, encoded in the UTF-8 character encoding.

Date →Sun, 05 Feb 2017 02:58:28 GMT
Time and date the message was sent.

ETag →"vFp1TYDMppbWxVi0Wgw_upD83cI/ctgebTu1fuGHbw8v20cGVPe7GuQ"
identifier for a specific version of a resource.

Expires →Sun, 05 Feb 2017 02:58:28 GMT
Time and date where the message is stale

Server →GSE
Tells what server is used to handle the request.

Vary →Origin
Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.

Vary →X-Origin
Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server

X-Content-Type-Options →nosniff
X-Content-Type-Options is marker to indicate the MIME types in the Content-Type headers should not be changed. The value nosniff will prevent Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.

X-Frame-Options →SAMEORIGIN
Instructs the browser to prevent any site with SAMEORIGIN in the response from being rendered within a frame.

X-XSS-Protection →1; mode=block
This lets domains toggle on and off the "XSS Filter" of IE8, which prevents some categories of XSS attacks.
